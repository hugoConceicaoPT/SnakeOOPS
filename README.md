# Projeto_OOPS
 Projeto_OOPS is a Java-based Snake game developed as part of an academic project. The game expands on the classic Snake concept by introducing several enhanced features and applying object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

Key features include:

Rotated obstacles for increased gameplay difficulty

Customizable snake size, allowing players to adjust the challenge

An automatic movement mode, where the snake moves without manual input

The application was built using Java with Swing for the graphical interface and serves as a demonstration of OOP concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

A detailed project report is available in Portuguese.
